Crystal collector game

This is a Jquery based guessing game. A random number within a range is set as the target value. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
